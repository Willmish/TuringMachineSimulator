# TuringMachineSimulator
As the name suggests, this is a Simulator of a Turing Machine. The programs (turing machines) are stored in .txt files,
where the alphabet, states, accepting states, starting state and transitions are defined. 

The simulation allows you to either run a turing machine (with a specified or test input) step by step, or automatically, with each step
occuring a specific time period after the previous one (specified by the user).
V0:
Currently, in order to add a new program you need to create a new .txt file, following the pattern in the other files define the turing
machine and manually add its option to the code.

TODOs:

  -I am currently working to improve that, a new feature will allow it to automatically
  find and make turing machines available to use.
  
  -Allow for creation of new turing machines while using the program (through the UI).
  
  -Add a GUI for the program.
  
  -Add a better visualisation of the machine (drawing states and transitions?).
